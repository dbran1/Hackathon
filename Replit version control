//  What next?  //
/* 
Character will have health points obviously. Enemies will have health points. The character can pick up stronger weapons through looting the bodies of small enemies and bosses.
Small enemies: could be something like a sewage pile or a toxic gas cloud. a zombie etc...
*  Turn based combat.
*  Instead of healing, a rest option?
Lets make this difficult to signify how pressing an issue climate change is.
Example: After a battle the character can choose to rest and regain a random ammount of health. 
Maybe an hour system? The player inputs how many hours they want to sleep for. The longer you sleep the more health you regain but the more chances there are of getting attacked by an enemy.

System: 
1] Fight small enemies. Loot them for armor and weapons.
2] Choice to search for more enemies or rest.
3] Resting for very long regains lots of health but is very dangerous. Cap of 24 hours. Minimum of 2 hours.
4] After a certain ammout of enemies are killed [ counter ] the chances of a the first boss exponentionalluy increase.
5] First boss fight. Chance to loot special/secret weapons etc...
6] Repeat.
7] Story elements are easy, the game always happens in order so we can do lore stuff aswell.

What will we need.
-  Loop statements for the base enemies. 
  -  Including: Loop statements for turn based combat.
  -  Looting function, randomizer/counter for weapons/tools.
-  Health, Defence and attack elements for the player. Health and damage elements for enemies & bosses.
-  4 levels of base enemies. [Inbetween boss fights and preluding the first boss]
-  9 bosses with unique attacks and individual abilities. Stick away from functions as each of these battles will be different.
-  Catalogue of secret & rare weapons aquired from killing bosses.
-  Story elements, background lore, finishing & polishing etc...
-  Everything (the game itself) held within an "if health" statement.
-  Attributes the player collects after killing enemies or accomplishing things.

Chance: The accumulatory 100% for calculating which attacks are dealt. For example, if I had a 75% chance to punch and 25% chance to kick, i would be technically punching thrice as often as I kick in a fight.

//  Looting: Generally increasing as the game goes on after a boss fight or an enemy fight you can choose to loot for supplies. A first counter dictates how many items you recieve. Example: 6 Items. A second counter decides if the loot is a weapon or one of the types of armor. Helmet, Pauldrons, Chestplate, Gauntlets, Greaves. A third counter decides which item to give for the corresponding type.
//  Example: First Counter [2 items], Second Counter [Weapon, Gloves], Third Counter [Fossilized Pike, Earthburn Shoulderplate]  //
//  We might remove the first counter and make it a constant, depending on the boss fought or enemies fought.  //
